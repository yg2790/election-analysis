## Election - Audit Summary
This script can be adjusted to incorporate any election results with any number of counties and candidates. As long as the format of csv remains the same, with the same delimiter, the script can import any other data set and output the winning candidates and states. If there are changes to the format, we can adjust the columns read by the csv that is assigned to the specific variables to adapt the script to other files.<br />
For example, the number in the brackets can be changed to the corresponding column index depending on the location of the corresponding information in the file.<br />
